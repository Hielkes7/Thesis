how much curl does a cloud filled with clumps have?

what should I do with the massdistance figure? I feel like I can't implement
the values but I should expect my program to have the same outcome as your figure
So I'll use it as a testing tool to see if my code is reliable.

ask if the fit of the radius mass relation is a good one
