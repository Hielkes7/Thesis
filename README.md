# Thesis
Hi Sam, welcome to my repository. I'll make a better README later on.

## A brief description of how to use my program N_body
In the function "set_up" all the initial conditions are chosen by the user. There are also some premade options, like particle density. You can choose between a evenly distributed particle density or a powerlaw distribution. There are some forces you can toggle on and off: the gravity of the centred star, the gravity amongst particles themself, radiation pressure (incorrect formula), gas pressure (incorrect formula), clump evaporation (non existing but first to come) and stellar win (non existing). Lastly there is the option to make a live animation or a GIF. Choose either one of them, if they are both true the GIF will fail.

Tips: When just using the gravity of the star you can animate up to 2k particles before it gets laggy. When the gravity of the particles are on as well you can max animate around 200 particles before it gets laggy.

Cheers.
